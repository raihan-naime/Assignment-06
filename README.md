#### 1) What is the difference between var, let, and const?

        Var: var is a functional scoped variable and even global scoped when it is declared outside a function. it get hosted and its initial value is undefined.

        Let: Let is a blocked scoped variable. It is hoisted but not initialized. It gets temporal dead zone until the declaration. Using let we can re-assign value but can't re-declare.

        Const: It is almost like let but the key difference between let and const is we can't re assign the value of const.

#### 2) What is the difference between map(), forEach(), and filter()? 

        map(): we use map when we need  a new array with transformed values form an another array. it returns a new array with same length. 

        forEach(): we use forEach function as like 'for of loop'. when we want to do something with each element like updating DOM and so on.

        filter(): when we need some specific element form an array according to condition or conditions we use filter function.

#### 3) What are arrow functions in ES6?

        arrow function is a shorter form of function where we can avoid function keyword.

#### 4) How does destructuring assignment work in ES6?
        we use destructuring assignment to extract values form array or object and assign them to variables in a summarized way.

#### 5) Explain template literals in ES6. How are they different from string concatenation?

        Template literals is backticks (`). we use it instead of quotes of (') or ("). we can embed variables and expressions directly inside strings and write multi-line strings without special characters through template literals.
